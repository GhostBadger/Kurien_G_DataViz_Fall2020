# Kurien_G_DataViz_Fall2020
Telling a story about Canada using the Olympics data and by learning and matplotlab to create three different data points and two visualizations for each (6 charts total) and adding all of it to one page html page
<h1> A single page html site that will display canadian stats in the Winter Olympics</h1>

*The python scripts used to make the graphs are included if you want to have some fun with them*

### Prerequisites
if you want to run the python scripts that build the charts that I used, all you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/releases/3.0) 

### Author
Georgey Kurien aka GhostBadger or FalseTesla

### Usage
Clone the project, <code>cd</code> to your `directory/download`, and open the html file in a browser of your choice. Preferably [google chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/) since that is the browser I used to build this site.
